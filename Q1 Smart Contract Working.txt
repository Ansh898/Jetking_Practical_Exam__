 1) How does actually Smart Contracts Work?

Ans - Smart Contracts are executing programs that are store in blockchain network such as ethereum .
They operate as decentralized such as etherium . They Operate as decentralized applications that can automate the negotiation 
and enforcement of rules and agreements between parties . 

When a smart contract is created , it is compiled into bytecode and deployed to the blockchain . 
The code is then stored in a contract account , which has a unique address on the blockchain 
once deployed the contract is immutable meaning that its code and logic cannot be changed .
